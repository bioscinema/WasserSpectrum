#' Permutation-Based Wasserstein Test for Two-Group Alpha Diversity Comparison
#'
#' Performs a two-sample hypothesis test for distributional differences in alpha diversity
#' between two groups using the 1D Wasserstein distance (also known as Earth Moverâ€™s Distance).
#' This test is robust to ties and sensitive to shifts in location, scale, and shape of the
#' diversity distribution. The null distribution is generated via permutation of group labels.
#'
#' @param df A data frame containing the alpha diversity values and group labels.
#' @param feature_col A string specifying the column name in \code{df} corresponding to the feature of interest (e.g., taxon, gene, or diversity index).
#' @param group_col A string specifying the column name in \code{df} indicating the group variable.
#' Must have exactly two unique values.
#' @param nperm Number of permutations used to generate the null distribution (default is 1000).
#' @param plot Logical indicating whether to display a histogram of the null distribution
#' with the observed statistic marked (default is \code{TRUE}).
#' @param seed An integer seed for reproducibility (default is 123).
#'
#' @return A list with the following components:
#' \item{statistic}{Observed Wasserstein distance between the two groups.}
#' \item{p_value}{Permutation p-value comparing observed statistic to null distribution.}
#' \item{null_distribution}{A numeric vector containing the permuted test statistics.}
#'
#' @details
#' The test computes the 1D Wasserstein distance between the empirical distributions
#' of the alpha diversity values in the two groups. A permutation-based p-value is calculated
#' by comparing the observed distance to the distribution of distances obtained from permuted group labels.
#'
#' This approach is particularly well-suited to microbiome studies, where diversity distributions
#' may exhibit heavy ties, skewness, and heterogeneity that are poorly captured by traditional
#' location-based tests.
