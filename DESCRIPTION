Title: Wasserstein-Based Inference on Distributional Diversity Patterns
Version: 0.1.0
Description: 
  Provides statistical tools for quantile-based inference on alpha-diversity 
  indices in microbiome and ecological data. The package implements the Wasserstein 
  spectrum framework for modeling diversity distributions using basis projection, 
  enabling Wald-type and permutation tests on center, dispersion, and shape features. 
  Functions include spectrum curve estimation, quantile-wise comparisons, FrÃ©chet 
  Wasserstein tests, and global/contrast-based MANOVA for group-level differences.
  Useful for identifying complex distributional shifts beyond mean differences in 
  microbial or ecological diversity.
